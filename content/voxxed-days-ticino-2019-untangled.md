title: Untangled — Sneak peek at Project Loom — Voxxed Days Ticino 2019 (EN)
date: 2019-10-05T11:15:00+01:00
parent: talks
group: "Java"
description: "In this presentation I explore synchronous and asynchronous APIs, blocking and non-blocking calls and try to explain that synchronous is not synonym of blocking and async is not a synonym of non-blocking.


Then I introduce Project Loom's **user threads/fibers** by presenting what are continuations, how asynchronous code can be wrapped in a synchronous API via continuations and the support required by the JVM/JDK.


And finally I present the current state of Project Loom.
"
abstract: "Concurrent programming borrows a lot of terms from weaving and twists our minds with intertwined concepts: fibers, threads, lightweight-threads, green threads, loom...
Maybe you've heard about coroutines? Don't worry, everything is linked.
           

During this talk, we'll get weaving, show code samples and talk about project Loom, whose goal is to bring “lightweight concurrency“ mechanisms to the JVM, along with APIs to embroider the story.
           

We will talk about project Loom's inception and recent prototypes. You will also see its mesh goes far beyond “simple“ primitives to revolutionize the JVM.
