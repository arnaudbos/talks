group: "Java"
abstract: "Concurrent programming borrows a lot of terms from weaving and twists our minds with intertwined concepts: fibers, threads, lightweight-threads, green threads, loom...
Maybe you've heard about coroutines? Don't worry, everything is linked.
           

During this talk, we'll get weaving, show code samples and talk about project Loom, whose goal is to bring “lightweight concurrency“ mechanisms to the JVM, along with APIs to embroider the story.
           

We will talk about project Loom's inception and recent prototypes. You will also see its mesh goes far beyond “simple“ primitives to revolutionize the JVM.
