title: Introduction to Clojure at the Toulouse Java User Group
date: 2017-11-09T20:00:00+01:00
parent: talks
group: "Clojure"
description: Lisp and Clojure in French at the Toulouse JUG meetup. In this presentation I talk about Lisp, its syntax and AST. Then I introduce Clojure's philosophy of values, identity and change through the use of analogies and mythology. I present the Epochal Time Model as well as Clojure's Persistent Data-Structures and finish with a quick live demo to present Clojure's syntax and some functions from the standard library. The last slides are a opening on ClojureScript and reframe by Fran√ßois Royer, unfortunately the recording of this part of the talk has failed, so there's no video...
